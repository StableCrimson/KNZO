# KNZO - Animated Logs

![Example](demo.gif)

## TODO

- Add docs
- Add support for progress bars

KNZO is a wrapper of the Python `rich` library that allows for logs and terminal content to be scripted and displayed.

KNZO outputs the scripted log directly to the terminal. However I am working on adding support for outputting the contents to an actual log file.

Also on support for using `vhs` to allow the script to be recording and output as a GIF, MP4, or series of frames for use in video editing.
